export const exampleText = `My name is Sarah Wilson, and I'm a software developer with over 4 years of experience specializing in full-stack web development. I'm passionate about creating clean, maintainable code and improving user experiences. I have a strong background in React ecosystem and modern JavaScript development practices.

I graduated from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Computer Science in June 2019. Later that year, I also completed a Full-Stack Engineering Certificate from Codecademy in December 2019.

I've been working at Fintech Solutions Ltd as a Senior Frontend Developer since March 2022. I'm the lead frontend developer for the company's main financial dashboard product, managing a team of three developers. My major projects include:
- Leading a complete redesign of the main dashboard interface, resulting in 40% improvement in user engagement and 25% reduction in customer support tickets.
- Implementing performance optimizations that improved application loading time by 60% through code splitting and lazy loading.

Before that, I worked at WebTech Solutions as a Frontend Developer from July 2019 to February 2022. There, I developed and maintained multiple client websites and web applications. One of my key projects was building a responsive e-commerce platform serving 10,000+ daily users, integrating with Stripe and inventory management systems.

My technical skills include: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git, AWS, REST APIs, Jest, and Tailwind CSS.

I've also created several personal projects including:
1. Health Tracker App - A full-stack application for tracking fitness goals and nutrition, with features like workout planning, meal tracking, and progress visualization. It uses React Native, Express.js, MongoDB, and Chart.js.
2. Weather Dashboard - A real-time weather dashboard with location-based forecasting and severe weather alerts, built with React and the OpenWeather API.

I'm a native English speaker, and I also speak French at B1 level and German at A2 level.
